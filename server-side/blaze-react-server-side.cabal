version:             0.1.0.0
synopsis:            Server-side execution of blaze-react apps.
description:         This is an experimental library exploring a design for
                     writing GUI apps in a compositional and portable fashion.
                     The rendering is based on using Facebooks ReactJS and
                     ReactNative to achieve proper web/native UI's. The
                     compositionality is achieved by separating the UI state
                     and state transitions from the concrete rendering
                     backend.
